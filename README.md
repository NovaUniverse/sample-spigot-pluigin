# sample spigot pluigin
This is a sample plugins for spigot servers that showcases how make a basic plugin, how to add custom commands to the game and how to modify the games behaviour using the event system

The plugin adds the following functions:
* A configurable welcome message when players join
* Entities no longer take explosion damage

# Setting up the project
Before you start you will need to install the following software:
* A java 17 JDK
* Apache maven
* A code editor of your choise that can handle java maven projects. some editors i would recommand are intellij, eclipse or visual studio code

## Installing maven
This guide will walk you thru how to install maven https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/

## Setting up the spigot server
Latest version of the spigot server software can be found here https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot
* Download the server jar
* Create a folder for your server and move the downloaded jar to that folder
* Launch the server by opening a terminal in the server folder and run the command `java -jar .\spigot-1.19.4.jar`
* Edit the file `eula.txt` generated by the server and change the line saying `eula=false` to `eula=true`
* Start the server with the same command as before
* to stop the server run the `/stop` command

## Importing the project to your editor
Since every editor has their own way to import maven project i would recommend googling how to import maven project into the editor of your choise.

if you are using vs code you should just be able to open the folder in vs code


## Compiling and testing
* Run the build.bat file in the sample project or open a terminal and run `mvn clean package`
* Move the plugin jar file from the `target` folder of the sample project to the `plugin` folder of your server
* Restart the minecraft server
* You should now be able to join the server by opening minecarft and going to multiplayer -> direct connect and using the ip `127.0.0.1`
